# U-Net Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the U-Net architecture for image segmentation tasks. The U-Net model is widely used in biomedical image segmentation and has shown great performance in various applications.
The implementation is based on the original paper "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation" by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox.
The model is implemented in PyTorch and includes training and evaluation scripts, as well as a sample dataset for testing purposes.
The U-Net architecture consists of a contracting path (encoder) and an expansive path (decoder), allowing the model to capture both local and global features in the input images. The architecture is designed to work with images of arbitrary size and can be easily adapted for different segmentation tasks.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, you can use pip. Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To use the U-Net model, you can import the `UNet` class from the `unet.py` file. You can create an instance of the model and specify the input channels and output classes.

```python
from unet import UNet
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torchvision.datasets import VOCSegmentation
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision.datasets import VOCSegmentation
